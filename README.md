#Project Overview

This is a Python-based AI Virtual Assistant, inspired by Alexa. The assistant listens to your voice commands and responds naturally using macOS’s text-to-speech engine.
It is designed as an internship project and demonstrates basic AI assistant functionalities like voice recognition, web search, and multimedia commands.
Features
✅ Voice Command Recognition – Listens when you say “Alexa”
✅ Text-to-Speech Responses – Speaks all answers with natural voice
✅ Time and Date Information – Tells current time
✅ YouTube Integration – Opens YouTube and plays songs
✅ Web Search – Answers questions using pywhatkit or web search
✅ Expandable Commands – Easy to add more commands (weather, jokes, small talk, etc.)
